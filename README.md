[![Around The U.S.][product-screenshot]](https://ozansevkin.github.io/Project_Around-the-US//)

## Overview

- This project is a social media profile page with basic javascript functionalities.

- It has been coded to be adaptive on popular screen sizes from 320px to 1280+ px.

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SurN1jaeEQIhuZEDMhmWWf/Sprint-4-Around-The-U.S.-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1) file has been used as the design spec.

- Design included 2 different layouts for 1280px and 320px and hover states. Multiple breakpoints have been implemented for smooth transition between these layouts.

- Javascript event listeners, functions, query selectors have been used to open the popup, edit profile info based on the entered data by the user and close the popup.

- All images and icons have been imported from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SurN1jaeEQIhuZEDMhmWWf/Sprint-4-Around-The-U.S.-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1) file and optimized with [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) and [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) for fast loading time.

- BEM methodology with flat file structure has been used.

- [A live version](https://ozansevkin.github.io/Project_Around-the-US/) of the main branch deployed to github pages.
